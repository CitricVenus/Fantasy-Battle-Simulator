In this project, you will build a Fantasy Battle Simulator that brings together various characters, abilities, and battle scenarios. The primary objective is to demonstrate effective exception handling in a complex application. You will create a dynamic system where different characters engage in battles, each with unique attributes and abilities. To ensure smooth gameplay, you will implement robust error-handling mechanisms that manage unexpected events and prevent crashes.

Key Objectives:

    Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions during gameplay, such as invalid character actions, incorrect input, or unforeseen game states.
    Implement custom exceptions (e.g., InvalidActionException, CharacterNotFoundException) to address specific error scenarios and provide meaningful feedback to the player.
    Ensure resource management by using finally blocks where appropriate (e.g., saving game state, releasing resources).
    Demonstrate best practices in throwing and declaring exceptions, ensuring predictable behavior and clear code logic.

Project Scope:

    Create classes for various characters (e.g., warriors, mages, archers), each with unique stats and abilities.
    Design a battle system where characters can attack, defend, or use special abilities, with the game managing turns and tracking health points.
    Implement features like selecting characters, initiating battles, and applying various actions, while handling potential errors (e.g., trying to perform actions on defeated characters).
    Ensure that all actions are checked for validity, throwing and catching appropriate exceptions when necessary, to keep the game running smoothly without crashes.

By the end of this project, you will have a fully functional Fantasy Battle Simulator that demonstrates how to effectively use Java exception handling in a complex, interactive environment. This will prepare you to handle error management in real-world applications, ensuring robust and reliable software.
